{"name":"audiofile","body":"The Audio File Library handles reading and writing audio files in many\r\ncommon formats.\r\n\r\nKey goals of the Audio File Library are file format transparency and data\r\nformat transparency. The same calls for opening a file, accessing and\r\nmanipulating audio metadata (e.g. sample rate, sample format, textual\r\ninformation, MIDI parameters), and reading and writing sample data will\r\nwork with any supported audio file format. Likewise, the format of the\r\naudio data presented to the application need not be tied to the format\r\nof the data contained in the file.\r\n\r\nThe following file formats are currently supported:\r\n* AIFF/AIFF-C\r\n* WAVE\r\n* NeXT .snd/Sun .au\r\n* Berkeley/IRCAM/CARL Sound File\r\n* Audio Visual Research\r\n* Amiga IFF/8SVX\r\n* Sample Vision\r\n* Creative Voice File\r\n* NIST SPHERE\r\n* Core Audio Format\r\n\r\nThe following compression formats are currently supported:\r\n* G.711 mu-law and A-law\r\n* IMA ADPCM\r\n* Microsoft ADPCM","tagline":"Audio File Library","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
